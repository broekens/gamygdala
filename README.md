# gamygdala
An emotion engine for games based on the Gamygdala approach (with an eyewink to game and amygdala).

This is the main repository for the Gamygdala emotion engine.
It is used for emotion simulation in NPCs or player controlled characters in games.
For now we have luanch the javascript version of the system
For more info visit the website (http://www.joostbroekens.com/gamygdala).
You can read more there, and run the example code.
The example code is based on the game engine Phaser from photonstorm (http://www.photonstorm.com/).
Gamygdala itself is not dependent on Phaser, but we have created two Plugin classes so that easy integration is possible with the Phaser Plugin system.

To see the running example that explains Gamygdala usage, or to play the two (simple!) example games, visit http://www.joostbroekens.com/gamygdala.
To get a complete local copy that runs, download the master branch, and unzip.
Run mongoose-free-5.3.5.exe which creates a simple web server with root dir the local dir where gamygdala is in.
Then visit: http://localhost:8080 and click on the link to see the example.
