    This method decays for all registered agents the emotional state and relations. It performs the decay according to the time passed, so longer intervals between consecutive calls result in bigger clunky steps.
    Typically this is called automatically when you use startDecay(), but you can use it yourself if you want to manage the timing.
    This function is keeping track of the millis passed since the last call, and will (try to) keep the decay close to the desired decay factor, regardless the time passed
    So you can call this any time you want (or, e.g., have the game loop call it, or have e.g., Phaser call it in the plugin update, which is default now).
    Further, if you want to tweak the emotional intensity decay of individual agents, you should tweak the decayFactor per agent not the "frame rate" of the decay (as this doesn't change the rate).
